This repo contains two projects. The first project UoT_CodeSpace/uot is the mobile platform project. 
The second project is UoT_CodeSpace/uot_HybridPlatform, this project is ready to switch between mobile Android, standalone, and WebGL platforms.

Both projects share the exact same functionality.

Game Title: Universe of Things
Team name: Tempus Fugit

Game Description:
The game is built in Unity and written in C#. The game environment mimics an orthographic view of an arcade screen. The player can move in two dimensions although the graphics are in three dimensions. The physics of the game make it a good application for mobile development and is a lot of fun to play on the phone.

The player is lost in space and encounters hazards along the way he/she must destroy to survive. There are many different types of hazards but mainly there are asteroids with different features or behavior. Then there are enemy ships that will fire and pursue the player. The boss enemy ships are larger in size and more intelligent and aggressive when attacking. There are also environment collectables including weapons, points, and health for the player to collect.

Additional functionality includes: 
Database communication and player account
Fully functional navigational GUI
High score board
Player selection
Level selection
Audio mixer
